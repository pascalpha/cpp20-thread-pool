# C++ 20 Thread Pool

## Thread Pool Reimplemented
Years of enterprise programming experience in Java caused me to raise my eyebrows at the fact that C++ lacks a portable implementation of thread pool model. It is not difficult to conceive of a possibility and many people have already taken the actions. 
Implementations abound and yet many were devised without C++ 20 in mind. Since the language now offers many happy features such as perfectly forwarded pack expansion in capture list, it also offers a good chance to show that the language is still of great concern to the concurrent programming community, hence the repository.

1. Header-only
2. No dependencies other than the STL
